# Icefabric

## The mission

The idea for the icefabric came from the need to version control datasets for the National Water Model 4.0. There were many different file formats, and hydrofabric versions, but the need for an [Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/) style backend was realized. The name itself, icefabric, is a reference to this.
